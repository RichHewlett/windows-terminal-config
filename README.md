Windows Terminal Configuration (settings.json etc) 

Settings.json file found at: 

C:\Users\<YOURUSERNAME>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState

OR 

In Windows Terminal, go to Settings, click the settings cog at the bottom left and it opens the file for modification. 

Notes: 
 - You may need to replace <USERNAME> in any file paths where a user name is included. 
 - Check all file paths are valid. e.g. If using VS2019 Dev Command Prompt profile it assumes Visual Studio community edition is installed, if using Enterprise then correct the file paths to /Enterprise/ instead of /Community/.
